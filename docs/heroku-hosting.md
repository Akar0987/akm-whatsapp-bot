- Now the bot will be deployed in under a minute.

# ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è FAiling to do the below step will stop the bot from working

- Since heroku uses Dyno sleeping in which if an app has a free web dyno, and that dyno receives no web traffic in a 30-minute period, it will sleep. In addition to the web dyno sleeping, the worker dyno (if present) will also sleep. and if a sleeping web dyno receives web traffic, it will become active again after a short delay (assuming your account has free dyno hours available) You can use [Cron job](https://console.cron-job.org) to ping the heroku app every 30 minutes to prevent it from sleeping. Heroku will stop the bot if the website does not receive any traffic.
- Create an account on [cron job](https://console.cron-job.org/signup).
- Create a [new job](https://console.cron-job.org/jobs/create), fill the title and url of the bot and and keep the execution schedule to 15 minute.
- Now click on create button.
- The bot will be ping every 15 minutes and it will never sleep(for 550 Hour which is the limit per month).
